Hello there! You are viewing my repository that is dedicated to **Formula 1 World Championship**, which is one of the most prestigious motorsport discipline and is spectated by millions of people worldwide on live, TV or online sources.

As a data science enthusiast and have been following F1 for over two decades, my aim here is to make datasets and to enable analyses on drivers and teams with regards to their race results and other important sessions throughout the seasons.

## Source

All these data are obtained from Formula 1 Official [Web Site](https://www.formula1.com/), plus EA & Codemasters F1 Games for driver ratings [here](https://www.ea.com/games/f1/f1-22/driver-ratings/ratings-database?isLocalized=true).

## IMPORTANT!

_If you'd like to use these datasets and wish to perform your own analyses in your works, please don't forget to put a reference for the original owner's (**toUpperCase78**) repo and give kudos._ **Thank you in advance...**

## Current Plans

**2022 Season has come to an end!** Thus, the datasets for race results, qualifying results and sprint race results are complete. That means, they are now ready for data analyses! Together with this availability, my plan is to release the 2022 Season analyses as quickly as possible!

Of course, **2023 Season has started and reached the first half of the season!** Therefore, new datasets that are related to race and qualifying results will arrive on the way as the season progresses, including _sprint_ and _sprint shootout_ results.

Meanwhile, there exist all race results of 2013-2018 seasons right now, contained in a separate folder and retroactively more previous seasons will be uploaded some time.
